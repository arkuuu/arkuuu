### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I work as a Senior Software Developer at CHECK24, with a focus on PHP, but also JS
- In my spare time I currently learn iOS development
- I am the creator of [Segeltrimm App](https://www.segeltrimm-app.de), a small iOS app and my hobby project
- When I'm not programming, I set sails on the Baltic Sea with my wife and our two little daughters
- I'm looking for a 100% remote job that allows me to work at my boat office (at least sometimes)
