### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm working as a Senior Software Developer at CHECK24, with focus on PHP, but also JS
- In my spare time I'm currently learning iOS development
- I'm the creator of [Segeltrimm App](https://www.segeltrimm-app.de), a small iOS app and my hobby project
- When I'm not programming, I'm sailing on the Baltic Sea with my wife and our little daughter
- I'm looking for a 100% remote job that will allow me to work from my boat in the future
